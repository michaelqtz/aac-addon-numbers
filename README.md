# Numbers
What do they mean mason?

Did you just lose a raid vs. raid engagement? Are you trying to decide between blaming your raid for their skill, enemy for their hacking and/or RMTing, or wiping out the "Zerg" card? Well, with "Numbers", you can check how many unique players are actively participating in a fight. There is a reset button for if you're interested in short-term stats, or you can leave the meter up the whole spawn of content and see how many unique players come and go.

**Please note, this is a work in progress addon and will be actively expanded. Leave feedback here or in my DMs and I'll incorporate it the best I can!**
